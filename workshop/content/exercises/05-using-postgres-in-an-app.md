Title: Using Postgres in an Application

For our Application example, we'll launch a copy of Etherpad and configure it for use with the db:

### Run the Application

Let's give it a try! Deploy `etherpad` with:

```execute-1
export DB_SVC="mycluster.${PGO_NAMESPACE}.svc.cluster.local"
export DB_REPLICA_SVC="mycluster-replica.${PGO_NAMESPACE}.svc.cluster.local"
oc new-app -p DB_HOST=$DB_SVC -f etherpad-template.yaml
```

You should see output similar to this:

```
--> Deploying template "postgres-lab-workshops-n3v3r/etherpad" for "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ryanj/docker-openshift-et
herpad/master/etherpad-template.yaml" to project postgres-lab-workshops-n3v3r                                              

     Etherpad

    Access your application via route 'etherpad-postgres-lab-workshops-n3v3r.apps.ryanj-2a63.openshiftworkshop.com'            
    Run 'oc status' to view your app.
```

The `etherpad` host address should be visible in the output, but you can also look it up later with `get routes`:

```execute-1
oc get routes
```

The URL should be:

http://etherpad-%project_namespace%.%cluster_subdomain%/

This may take a minute or more to download and boot the image, and to initialize the database using our established credentials.  Watch for a `1/1` Ready status from our `etherpad` pod using the watcher we already have running. You can also monitor the status of the deployment using:

```execute
oc rollout status dc/etherpad
```

After the `etherpad` pod reports "Ready 1/1" you should be able to connect to the app, write some test data, and verify that etherpad is working! To connect to the app, simply click on the URL above.

### Final replication check
Etherpad stores it's data in a table named `store`.  

Let's query our replicas to see if they're up-to-date and ready to automatically replace any primary db nodes that might fail, or need to be rescheduled, migrated, upgraded, or disrupted in some other way:

```execute-1
psql -h $DB_REPLICA_SVC -U etherpad etherpad -c 'select * from store;'
```

Congratulations - If you've found data in this table, your then db replication for etherpad is working as expected!

## Summary

Now that you've completed this lab, you should be familiar with:
* How to create a Postgres Enterprise cluster using the Crunchy Enterprise Postgres operator
* How to create a Postgres database using the `pgo` command-line tool, and how to store and retrieve data using basic SQL statements
* How to validate Data Replication and High Availability features for this cluster
* How to power a realtime multiuser collaborative editor using your new highly-available PostgreSQL datastore!
